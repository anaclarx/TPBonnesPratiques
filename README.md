# TPBonnesPratiques
To-Do from Design Practices class

 We have a small web server that receive requests with the method getRequest();
 The first parameter is the path of the request, and the second is an object that represents the  user that is currently logged in.
 
 Had to implement the following Design Patterns: Chain of Responsibility Pattern and Observable pattern. 
 
 Java 17 and SDK 17 were used to build this project.
 
 To run on Intellij it is necessary to go to the Main file and press the play button on the top of the IDE.
